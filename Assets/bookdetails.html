                    Assassin's Creed: Last Descendants – Tomb of the Khan is a young adult novel written by Matthew J.
                    Kirby. The second
                    part of his young adults novel series, Tomb of the Khan is the follow-up to Assassin's Creed: Last
                    Descendants and saw a
                    release on 27 December 2016.
                    <br><br>
                    Owen and his friends have lost. They managed to do something incredible, but were defeated
                    nonetheless. When they
                    located the first piece of an ancient and powerful relic long considered a legend-the Trident of
                    Eden-it seemed little
                    could stop them. This piece was sought by the Brotherhood of Assassins and the Templar Order, but
                    before either
                    organization could take the piece, it was stolen by an unknown third party. The relationship between
                    the teens
                    fractured-Owen and his friend Javier taking sides with the Assassins, the others with the Templars.
                    <br> <br>
                    Now there are still two pieces of the Trident of Eden to find, and both are determined not to repeat
                    their mistakes. The
                    next piece is said to have been buried with the Mongol warlord Mongke Khan, whose tomb has never
                    been found. Teens on
                    either side of the conflict will have to go into simulations in war-torn Mongolian China in a race
                    against time to
                    discover the next piece, and ensure their safety before their enemies find it first.

                                After a devastating nuclear war in 199X, the world is in ruins. Bandits have seized
                                power and started preying on the
                                weak. For many people, every day is a struggle for sheer survival. But then a glimmer of
                                hope appears in the firmament:
                                Kenshiro, who has been reduced to a tramp, is determined to protect the people and
                                restore justice to the world. He uses

                                Shy Ken Kaneki is thrilled to go on a date with the beautiful Rize. But it turns out
                                that she’s only interested in his body—eating it, that is. When a morally questionable
                                rescue transforms him into the first half-human half-Ghoul hybrid, Ken is drawn into the
                                dark and violent world of Ghouls, which exists alongside our own.

                                Ball), and they are beginning to go stir crazy. The Heffleys can not afford an expensive
                                vacation, but they discuss
                                possible family vacations that they would be able to afford. Unable to reach a decision,

                                from his great-grandmother, asking them to take his uncle's camper out of her driveway.
                                The family realizes that they
                                can vacation in the camper and not have to spend money at restaurants and hotels.

                                Girl with a Pearl Earring is a 1999 historical novel written by Tracy Chevalier. Set in
                                17th-century Delft, Holland, the
                                novel was inspired by local painter Johannes Vermeer's Girl with a Pearl Earring.
                                Chevalier presents a fictional account
                                of Vermeer, the model and the painting.
