Description:

This is my HTML and CSS only website for COSC2430 Web Programming Assessment 1.

The index.html is the main page of this website, and there are other folders that I've made to store my files such as Assets is to store the other pages for the website such as Contact, Category and Category 1 (same code but different information to display the sub categories) and finally books which display the book details. 

The other folders are CSS which contain 4 folders, each containing a style.css for each pages that I've created. Finally, the images folder contain the images I've used within the website.


As I mentioned above this website is all coded with HTML and CSS. I've use smooth-scrolling to get a smooth scroll animation when the user press a link on the navigation which the website will scroll down to that specific area. There'll be buttons such as 'view more' that leads the user to another page. For those pages I've shortened the navigation list and made adjustment so that the user can browse through easier and get back to the main page with ease. 

The website is responsive in smaller screen device. I came up with an idea to add a button that will open up the nav bar when in smaller screen. However, due to to my lack of understanding in advanced CSS I was not able to create. Therefore, I ended up with using display:block to create a vertical navbar  

Time constraints, since this website assignment is due within the day I only got at least a day to get everything done. However, I think that there could be some small errors I've made or missing information.


Book detail page is only a page, so when you press on another book view more button on it's pop up modal it'll redirect you to the page. However, the information will be another book as the assignment required you  to link all book to that Book detail page. Due to time constraints of the assessment and somewhat knowledge I was unable to create each pages for each books therefore, I'll come back to this website and improve it over time.
