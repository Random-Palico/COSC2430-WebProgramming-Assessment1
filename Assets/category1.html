                                good night. Would Wolf and his pup “kiss and then HOWL”? Would Bear and her cub “kiss
                                and then GROWL”? But what about Sloth and her baby? They move soooo slooowwwww . . .
                                they’re sure to be kissing from early evening until long after everyone else is fast

                                Paint by Sticker is the most exciting new idea in activity books, both for grown-ups and kids. A compelling activity for
                                crafters and artists, doodlers and colorers of all ages, each Paint by Sticker Kids book includes everything you need to
                                create ten vibrant, full-color “paintings.” The original images are rendered in low-poly, a computer graphics style
                                using geometric polygon shapes to create a 3D effect. As in paint-by-number, each template is divided into spaces, each
                                with a number that corresponds to a particular sticker. Find the sticker, peel it, and place it in the right space.
