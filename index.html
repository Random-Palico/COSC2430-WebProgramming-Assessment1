                <p>We have alot to choose from... <br> <br> If you are looking for a specific book, or even just
                    something you’d like to
                    read, it helps to know the various categories that bookstores use for shelving their products. <br>
                    <br>

                    Almost every store has three main categories of books in different locations on the sales floor –
                    Nonfiction,
                    Fiction, and Children’s. You will then find those sections of the bookstore divided into
                    sub-categories, and then
                    within those sub-categories will be more specific micro-categories. Many visitors to a bookstore
                    always head to one
                    part of the store, knowing that the books they usually like to read are in that area. <br> <br>

                    We have listed some out for you: <br> <br>

                                Owen and his friends have lost. They managed to do something incredible, but were
                                defeated nonetheless. When they
                                located the first piece of an ancient and powerful relic long considered a legend-the
                                Trident of Eden-it seemed little
                                could stop them. This piece was sought by the Brotherhood of Assassins and the Templar
                                Order, but before either
                                organization could take the piece, it was stolen by an unknown third party. The

                                fractured-Owen and his friend Javier taking sides with the Assassins, the others with
                                the Templars.

                                After a devastating nuclear war in 199X, the world is in ruins. Bandits have seized
                                power and started preying on the
                                weak. For many people, every day is a struggle for sheer survival. But then a glimmer of

                                Kenshiro, who has been reduced to a tramp, is determined to protect the people and

                                rescue transforms him into the first half-human half-Ghoul hybrid, Ken is drawn into the
                                dark and violent world of Ghouls, which exists alongside our own.

                                The Crusades is an authoritative, accessible single-volume history of the brutal struggle for the Holy Land in the
                                Middle Ages. Thomas Asbridge—a renowned historian who writes with “maximum vividness” (Joan Acocella, The New
                                Yorker)—covers the years 1095 to 1291 in this big, ambitious, readable account of one of the most fascinating periods in
                                history. From Richard the Lionheart to the mighty Saladin, from the emperors of Byzantium to the Knights Templar,
                                Asbridge’s book is a magnificent epic of Holy War between the Christian and Islamic worlds, full of adventure, intrigue,
                                and sweeping grandeur.

                                In A Walk in the Woods, Bill Bryson trekked the Appalachian Trail—well, most of it. In A Sunburned Country, he
                                confronted some of the most lethal wildlife Australia has to offer. Now, in his biggest book, he confronts his greatest
                                challenge: to understand—and, if possible, answer—the oldest, biggest questions we have posed about the universe and
                                ourselves. Taking as territory everything from the Big Bang to the rise of civilization, Bryson seeks to understand how
                                we got from there being nothing at all to there being us.

                                For decades, we’ve been told that positive thinking is the key to a happy, rich life. "F**k positivity," Mark Manson
                                says. "Let’s be honest, shit is f**ked and we have to live with it." In his wildly popular Internet blog, Manson doesn’t
                                sugarcoat or equivocate. He tells it like it is—a dose of raw, refreshing, honest truth that is sorely lacking today.

                                defeated nonetheless. When they
                                located the first piece of an ancient and powerful relic long considered a legend-the
                                Trident of Eden-it seemed little
                                could stop them. This piece was sought by the Brotherhood of Assassins and the Templar
                                Order, but before either
                                organization could take the piece, it was stolen by an unknown third party. The

                                After a devastating nuclear war in 199X, the world is in ruins. Bandits have seized
                                power and started preying on the
                                weak. For many people, every day is a struggle for sheer survival. But then a glimmer of

                                Kenshiro, who has been reduced to a tramp, is determined to protect the people and

                                that she’s only interested in his body—eating it, that is. When a morally questionable
                                rescue transforms him into the first half-human half-Ghoul hybrid, Ken is drawn into the
                                dark and violent world of Ghouls, which exists alongside our own.

                                possible family vacations that they would be able to afford. Unable to reach a decision, Greg's family receives a call
                                from his great-grandmother, asking them to take his uncle's camper out of her driveway. The family realizes that they
                                can vacation in the camper and not have to spend money at restaurants and hotels.
