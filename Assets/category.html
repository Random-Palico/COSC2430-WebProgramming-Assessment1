                                After a devastating nuclear war in 199X, the world is in ruins. Bandits have seized
                                power and started preying on the
                                weak. For many people, every day is a struggle for sheer survival. But then a glimmer of
                                hope appears in the firmament:
                                Kenshiro, who has been reduced to a tramp, is determined to protect the people and
                                restore justice to the world. He uses
                                a very special technique - and so begins an adventurous journey through the apocalyptic
                                wasteland!

                                Shy Ken Kaneki is thrilled to go on a date with the beautiful Rize. But it turns out
                                that she’s only interested in his body—eating it, that is. When a morally questionable
                                rescue transforms him into the first half-human half-Ghoul hybrid, Ken is drawn into the
                                dark and violent world of Ghouls, which exists alongside our own.

                                Girl with a Pearl Earring is a 1999 historical novel written by Tracy Chevalier. Set in
                                17th-century Delft, Holland, the
                                novel was inspired by local painter Johannes Vermeer's Girl with a Pearl Earring.
                                Chevalier presents a fictional account
                                of Vermeer, the model and the painting.

                                organization could take the piece, it was stolen by an unknown third party. The

                                of a satyr and a daughter of Athena, Percy must journey across the United States to
                                catch a thief who has stolen the original weapon of mass destruction — Zeus’ master
                                bolt. Along the way, he must face a host of mythological enemies determined to stop him.
                                Most of all, he must come to terms with a father he has never known, and an Oracle that
                                has warned him of betrayal by a friend.
